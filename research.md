# Research

My work in life science Sweden is quite varied with numerous different projects
relating to everything from transcriptomics, machine learning and pipeline
development. While I cannot share details of on-going NBIS projects due to
confidentiality agreements, the non-exhaustive list below will hopefully give
you an idea of some of the projects that I have and am working on.


## Projects

- Development of a bioinformatic pipeline for Spatial Transcriptomics and
  scRNA-seq data
- Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in crayfish immune cells
- Investigation of drug treatment in a co-culture of immune and cancer cells
  using scRNA-seq data
- Development of a bioinformatic pipeline for drug screening using RNA-seq
  data
- Analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data in dementia patients
- Transcriptional effect of drug treatments in a CRISPR cell line model

## PhD Thesis

- [Exploring genetic heterogeneity in cancer using high-throughput DNA and RNA
  sequencing](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1245671&dswid=-5743)
