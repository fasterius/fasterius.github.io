# Projects

My work in life science Sweden is quite varied with numerous different projects
relating to everything from transcriptomics, pipeline development and
statistics. While I cannot share details of on-going NBIS projects due to
confidentiality agreements, I here list some of my Open Source projects and
contributions.

## Open Source projects

These are open source projects I have created and/or maintain:
