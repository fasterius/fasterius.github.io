# Research

My work in life science Sweden is quite varied with numerous different projects
relating to everything from transcriptomics, machine learning and pipeline
development. While I cannot share details of on-going NBIS projects due to
confidentiality agreements, the non-exhaustive list below will hopefully give
you an idea of some of the projects that I have and am working on.

## Projects

* Development of a bioinformatic pipeline for Spatial Transcriptomics and
  scRNA-seq data using Nextflow
* Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in crayfish immune cells
* Investigation of drug treatment in a co-culture of immune and cancer cells
  using scRNA-seq data
* Development of a bioinformatic pipeline for drug screening using RNA-seq
  data and Nextflow
* Analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data in dementia patients
* Transcriptional effect of drug treatments in a CRISPR cell line model

## Resources

* [seqCAT](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/seqCAT.html){:target="blank"},
  an R/Bioconductor package for variant analysis and cell authentication using
  HTS data
- [VarClust](https://github.com/fasterius/VarClust), a Python package for
  variant analyses of single-cell HTS data
* [RNA-VC](https://github.com/fasterius/RNA-VC), a Snakemake pipeline for
  variant analyses of publicly available RNA-seq data

## PhD Thesis

* [Exploring genetic heterogeneity in cancer using high-throughput DNA and RNA
  sequencing](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1245671&dswid=-5743){:target="blank"}
