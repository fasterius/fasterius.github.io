# Research

My work in life science Sweden is quite varied with numerous different projects
relating to everything from transcriptomics, machine learning and pipeline
development. While I cannot share details of on-going NBIS projects due to
confidentiality agreements, the non-exhaustive list below will hopefully give
you an idea of some of the projects that I have and am working on.

## Projects

* Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in crayfish immune cells
* Investigation of drug treatment in a co-culture of immune and cancer cells
  using scRNA-seq data
* Development of a bioinformatic pipeline for drug screening using RNA-seq
  data and Nextflow
* Analysis of transcriptomic data in dementia patients
* Transcriptional effect of drug treatments in a CRISPR cell line model

## Resources

* [nf-core/spatialtranscriptomics](https://github.com/nf-core/spatialtranscriptomics){:target="blank"},
  a Nextflow/[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/){:target="blank"} pipeline for
  analysing spatial transcriptomics data
* [seqCAT](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/seqCAT.html){:target="blank"},
  an R/Bioconductor package for variant analysis and cell authentication using
  HTS data
* [VarClust](https://github.com/fasterius/VarClust){:target="blank"}, a Python package for
  variant analyses of single-cell HTS data
* [RNA-VC](https://github.com/fasterius/RNA-VC){:target="blank"}, a Snakemake pipeline for
  variant analyses of publicly available RNA-seq data

## Other Open Source contributions

* [nf-core/modules/spaceranger](https://nf-co.re/modules){:target="blank"}, a
  Nextflow/[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/){:target="blank"} module for the 10x
  Genomics Space Ranger software.

## PhD Thesis
