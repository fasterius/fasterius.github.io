# Projects

My work in life science Sweden is quite varied with numerous different projects
relating to everything from transcriptomics, pipeline development and
statistics. While I cannot share details of on-going NBIS projects due to
confidentiality agreements, I here list some of my Open Source projects and
contributions.

## Open Source projects

- [nf-core/spatialtranscriptomics](https://github.com/nf-core/spatialtranscriptomics){:target="blank"},
  a Nextflow/[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/){:target="blank"} pipeline for
  analysing spatial transcriptomics data
- [nf-core/modules/quartonotebook](https://nf-co.re/modules/quartonotebook){:target="blank"},
  a Nextflow/[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/){:target="blank"} module for rendering
  [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) notebooks.
- [seqCAT](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/seqCAT.html){:target="blank"},
  an R/Bioconductor package for variant analysis and cell authentication using
  HTS data
- [VarClust](https://github.com/fasterius/VarClust){:target="blank"}, a Python package for
  variant analyses of single-cell HTS data
- [RNA-VC](https://github.com/fasterius/RNA-VC){:target="blank"}, a Snakemake pipeline for
  variant analyses of publicly available RNA-seq data

## Open Source contributions

- [nf-core/modules/spaceranger](https://nf-co.re/modules/spaceranger_count){:target="blank"},
  a Nextflow/[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/){:target="blank"} module for the 10x
  Genomics Space Ranger software.

## PhD Thesis

- [Exploring genetic heterogeneity in cancer using high-throughput DNA and RNA
  sequencing](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1245671&dswid=-5743){:target="blank"}
