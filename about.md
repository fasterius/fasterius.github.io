# Erik Fasterius, PhD

I am a bioinformatician and scientist working mainly with computational biology,
pipeline development and advanced training. I come from a background in
biotechnology and thus have a deep understanding of both bioinformatics and the
underlying biology. I have experience working with machine learning, software
development, cancer biology, drug screening and cell line authentication.
Additional special interests include reprodubility and data visualization.

At my current workplace, the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden
([NBIS](https://nbis.se)), I offer advanced bioinformatic support and guidance
to life science researchers in Sweden. My current focus involves transcriptomics
and its applications in bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, as well as several
pipeline development projects. I am also engaged in advanced computational
biology and data analysis training at the European level through
[ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/sweden).
