<h2> Erik Fasterius, PhD </h2>

<p>

I am a bioinformatician and scientist working mainly with computational biology,
pipeline development and advanced training. I come from a background in
biotechnology and thus have an understanding of both bioinformatics and the
underlying biology. I have experience working with software development, machine
learning, cancer biology, drug screening and cell line authentication.
I am also very interested in reproducibility and data visualization.

<p>

I am analytically minded, thorough and enjoy problem-solving at all levels. I
have always liked sharing my knowledge with others, be that through more
traditional teaching avenues or through corridor-conversations with colleagues.
Learning new things is something I have always appreciated. I'm creative,
adaptable and social.

<p>

At my current workplace, the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden (<a href="https://nbis.se" target="blank">NBIS</a>),
I offer advanced bioinformatic support and guidance to life science researchers
in Sweden through the <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/" target="blank">SciLifeLab</a>
community. My current focus involves transcriptomics and its applications in
bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, as well as several pipeline development
projects using Nextflow and nf-core. I am also engaged in advanced computational
biology and data analysis training at the European level through <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/sweden" target="blank">ELIXIR</a>.
My work at NBIS allows me to help life science researchers in Sweden bring their
projects to completion with tailor-made bioinformatics solutions.
