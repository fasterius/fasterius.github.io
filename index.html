<h2> Erik Fasterius, PhD </h2>

<p>

I am a bioinformatician and scientist working mainly with computational biology,
pipeline development and advanced training. I come from a background in
biotechnology and thus have a deep understanding of both bioinformatics and the
underlying biology. I have experience working with machine learning, software
development, cancer biology, drug screening and cell line authentication.
Additional special interests include reprodubility and data visualization.

<p>

At my current workplace, the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden (<a href="https://nbis.se">NBIS</a>),
I offer advanced bioinformatic support and guidance to life science researchers
in Sweden through the <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/">SciLifeLab</a>
community. My current focus involves transcriptomics and its applications in
bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, as well as several pipeline development
projects. I am also engaged in advanced computational biology and data analysis
training at the European level through <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/sweden">ELIXIR</a>
