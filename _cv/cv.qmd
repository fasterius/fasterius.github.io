# Summary

I am a bioinformatician and a scientist working mainly with computational
biology, pipeline development and advanced training. I come from a background in
biotechnology and thus have a deep understanding of both bioinformatics and the
underlying biology. I have experience working with machine learning, software
development, cancer biology, drug screening and cell line authentication.
Additional special interests include reproducibility and data visualization. \

I am analytically minded, thorough and enjoy problem-solving at all levels. I
have always liked sharing my knowledge with others, be that through more
traditional teaching avenues or through corridor-conversations with colleagues.
Learning new things is something I have always appreciated. I'm creative,
adaptable and social.

# Teaching

I have been involved in a number of advanced courses related to bioinformatics
in the last few years. All of the courses are offered to PhD students, post-docs
and other high-level researchers in Sweden ([NBIS](https://nbis.se/)),
Switzerland ([SIB](https://www.sib.swiss/)) and other countries in the
[ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/) network. I am a Course Leader for the NBIS
Tools for Reproducible Research NBIS course. I am also a certified [Carpentry
Instructor](https://software-carpentry.org/). For a full list of the courses I
have taught, please follow [this link](https://fasterius.github.io/teaching/).
