# Summary

I am a bioinformatician and scientist specializing in computational biology,
pipeline development, and advanced training. I have led projects involving bulk
and single-cell **RNA-seq**, **spatial transcriptomics**, RNA-seq/WES-based
**variant analysis**, **transcriptional pharmacodynamics** and high-throughput
**drug screening**. I frequently collaborate with clinicians and other
non-bioinformaticians, guiding **experimental design** and generating hypotheses
that drive publications. \

I am passionate about reproducibility and data visualization, excelling at
designing scalable and reliable bioinformatic **pipelines** that empower
scientific discovery. Known for being analytical, thorough, and a natural
problem-solver, I thrive in **collaborative environments** and enjoy sharing
knowledge â€” whether through formal teaching, mentoring, or casual discussions
with colleagues. My curiosity, adaptability, and creativity drive me to
continuously learn and contribute to scientific research.

# Teaching

I have designed and led advanced bioinformatics courses, teaching over 250 PhD
students, postdocs and group leaders through the NBIS and ELIXIR networks. I
have delivered training sessions across Sweden, Europe and online, mainly
through **[Tools for Reproducible Research][TRR]**, for which I am a course
leader, but also **[Single cell RNA-seq data analysis][scRNA]** and
**[Introduction to bioinformatics using NGS data][NGS-intro]**. A comprehensive
teaching portfolio is available at **[my website][website]**.
