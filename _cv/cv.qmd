# Summary

I am a bioinformatician and a scientist working mainly with computational
biology, pipeline development and advanced training. I come from a background in
biotechnology and thus have an understanding of both bioinformatics and the
underlying biology. I have experience working with software development, machine
learning, cancer biology, drug screening and cell line authentication.
I am also very passionate about reproducibility and data visualization. \

I am analytically minded, thorough and enjoy problem-solving at all levels. I
have always liked sharing my knowledge with others, be that through more
traditional teaching avenues or through corridor-conversations with colleagues.
Learning new things is something I have always appreciated. I'm creative,
adaptable and social.

Here, I collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to deliver tailored bioinformatics solutions for high-impact research projects. Through my work at NBIS I designed and implemented several reproducible bioinformatic workflows, facilitating scalability and reliability for life science research. I led training initiatives both at the local Swedish level as well as at the European level through ELIXIR, empowering researchers with cutting-edge computational biology techniques.",

# Teaching

I have been involved in several advanced bioinformatics courses, all of which
are offered to PhD students, post-docs, group leaders and other researchers in
Sweden ([NBIS](https://nbis.se/)), Switzerland ([SIB](https://www.sib.swiss/))
and countries in the [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/) network. I am a Course
Leader for the NBIS Tools for Reproducible Research NBIS course. For a full list
of the courses I have taught, please visit [my website](https://fasterius.github.io/teaching/).
